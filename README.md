# ckanext-fairdatapoint

CKAN extension for FAIR data points. Contains a harvester for FAIR data points. In the future, the FAIR data point API might be supported by this extension too. 

## Stages

The harvester runs in three stages. Each of these stages can be modified.
 1. Gather stage. The gather stage uses the FairDataPointRecordProvider which implements the IRecordProvider interface to create a list of identifiers of the objects which should be included in the harvest. In case of a FAIR datab point, this list inlcudes catalogs and datasets. In the future, collections could be added;
 2. Fetch stage. The fetch stage downloads the actual source data. In this phase, additional data from other sources may be included to better suit the DCAT profile as expected by CKAN;
 3. Import stage. The import stage does the actual import. How the RDF from the FAIR data point is mapped to CKAN packages and resources is determined by so called application profiles. In case of a FAIR data point which uses custom fields, a profile must be created. A profile can be definied as a Python class in the the ckanext.fairdatapoint.profiles.py file. The new profile must be registered in the [ckan.rdf.profiles] section of setup.py. What profile is being used for a particular is determined by the harvester configuration. 

``
{
	"profiles": "fairdatapoint_dcat_ap"
}
``

To run the harvester from the command line:

``
ckan --config=<full path to CKAN ini-file> harvester run-test <id of harvester>
``

To rebuiod the index in case it is not automatically update after clearing all packages from a harvester:

``
ckan --config=<full path to CKAN ini-file> search-index rebuild
``

## Requirements

Compatibility with core CKAN versions:

| CKAN version    | Compatible? |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 2.6 and earlier | no          |
| 2.7             | no          |
| 2.8             | not tested  |
| 2.9             | yes         |
| 2.10            | not tested  |

Suggested values:

* "yes"
* "not tested" - I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't work
* "not yet" - there is an intention to get it working
* "no"


## Installation

**TODO:** Add any additional install steps to the list below.
   For example installing any non-Python dependencies or adding any required
   config settings.

To install ckanext-fairdatapoint:

1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example:

     . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

2. Clone the source and install it on the virtualenv

    git clone https://github.com/CivityNL/ckanext-fairdatapoint.git
    cd ckanext-fairdatapoint
    pip install -e .
	pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add `fairdatapoint` to the `ckan.plugins` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   `/etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini`).

4. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu:

     sudo service apache2 reload


## Config settings

None at present

**TODO:** Document any optional config settings here. For example:

	# The minimum number of hours to wait before re-checking a resource
	# (optional, default: 24).
	ckanext.fairdatapoint.some_setting = some_default_value


## Developer installation

To install ckanext-fairdatapoint for development, activate your CKAN virtualenv and
do:

    git clone https://github.com/CivityNL/ckanext-fairdatapoint.git
    cd ckanext-fairdatapoint
    python setup.py develop
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt


## Tests

To run the tests, do:

    pytest --ckan-ini=test.ini


## Releasing a new version of ckanext-fairdatapoint

If ckanext-fairdatapoint should be available on PyPI you can follow these steps to publish a new version:

1. Update the version number in the `setup.py` file. See [PEP 440](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers) for how to choose version numbers.

2. Make sure you have the latest version of necessary packages:

    pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine

3. Create a source and binary distributions of the new version:

       python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && twine check dist/*

   Fix any errors you get.

4. Upload the source distribution to PyPI:

       twine upload dist/*

5. Commit any outstanding changes:

       git commit -a
       git push

6. Tag the new release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the `setup.py` file. For example if the version number in `setup.py` is
   0.0.1 then do:

       git tag 0.0.1
       git push --tags
